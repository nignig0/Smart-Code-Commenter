# Smart-Code-Commenter
A wrapper around some ai model that helps you in commenting your java code 

Approach:
I thought it'll be more precise if I let it comment function by function rather than feeding the model the whole code 

Issues:
-It seems to repeat code 
-Or sometimes dream up code 
-Commenting isn't always accurate

To do:
-Add support for other languages?
I guess it could work with programming languages that are similar to java in syntaxs

Set up
- You'd need to create an account with Google Ai studio to get an api key
- Then you can download the code and run
